# Article summarizer

Uses [Txtify](https://txtify.it/) and [The Text API](https://www.thetextapi.com/) services to provide an extracive summary of a given webpage. I wrote the script just for the sake of trying the services, but with some extra work it could be useful to get a daily summary of news or blog articles.

### Usage

`TEXT_API_KEY="011235813" python summarize_article.py https://some-website/the-article.html`

You can get an API key for The Text API for free, though you'll likely consume all the credits after summarizing one or two articles.
